## This is a fork of the below fork lol
learning machine learnning :D
know so far:

Take however many inputs, and feed them through a large network. This network has many layers, each one with a different number of nodes (neurons). Each of your inputs (also a neuron, though it's mostly called that for convenience) gets multipled by a weight specific to that neuron and the next (so each neuron connects to each one before and after it). Each neuron (not weight!) has a specific bias to give it more or less 'signal strength', and then take the quadratic cost (error). We take mini batches of this error, and try to decrease this error by changing the weights and biases for each neuron (traveling down the gradient in n dimensions, where n is the number of inputs). We take small batches of this cost instead of calculating it for all weights and biases to make the process faster (it's a heuristic that's 'good enough'). 

To learn:
how does gradient descent actually work? how is it implemented?
and of course later move onto more complex machine learning algorithms like ppo

## This fork is made to work with the latest python versions (3.8.x to 3.10.x)

This is a fork of [Michael Nielsen](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) repository and is meant to be updated with the latest python and dependency versions. Most things have been updated and currently work. Any help is appreciated and if you spotted any problems, please open an issue and/or a PR.

# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains code samples for my book on ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com).

The code is written for Python 2.6 or 2.7. Michal Daniel Dobrzanski
has a repository for Python 3
[here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35). I
will not be updating the current repository for Python 3
compatibility.

The program `src/network3.py` uses version 0.6 or 0.7 of the Theano
library.  It needs modification for compatibility with later versions
of the library.  I will not be making such modifications.

As the code is written to accompany the book, I don't intend to add
new features. However, bug reports are welcome, and you should feel
free to fork and modify the code.
